#To pull the latest version
> git pull
> git submodule update --recursive

(The second line is there to get the latest version of leon (from my personal fork(so that it contains the webDSL) of the original leon))

#Duplication
the "library" folder of leon (containing the webDSL) is duplicated. It is present both in the "leon" folder (the gitsubmodule linked to my personal fork of leon)
and in the "shared" folder. The main reason for this is that the webDSL package had to be duplicated, and this package has:
 * To be present in the "leon/library folder", for leon to be able to compile/execute programs using it
 * To be present in the "shared/src/main/scala" folder, for scalajs to be able to use it on the client
(And scalajs cannot use source code that is outside of the "shared" folder, for unclear reasons).

The main differences between the 2 packages are:
 * the one from the "leon/library" folder is called "webDSL_Leon", while the one from "shared" is called "webDSL_Client"
 * webDSL_Leon uses leon.collection.List instead of scala.List because leon cannot understand scala.List
 * webDSL_Client uses scala.List because leon.collection.List does not appear to be pickable (~= serializable) by boopickle.
 * all the names from the webDSL_Client package are suffixed with "_Client" to avoid confusion.
